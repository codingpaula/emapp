# emapp

## Design

Currently implementing the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/QiPslvfwOitHkxM8pBEklR/EMApp?node-id=0%3A1).

## Development

Commands:

- `ng serve` for a dev server (`http://localhost:4200/`). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
- `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.
